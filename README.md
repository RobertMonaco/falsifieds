# Falsifieds

An attempt to build a reliable classification and detection system for real and fake news

## Motivation

Over the past several years, the creation and dissemination of fake news has become a serious cause for concern. Technologies such as social media and the ease of website creation has drastically lowered the "barrier to entry" for those wishing to spread false reports. Common motives include political persuasion, satire, sensationalism, etc.

We have decided to undertake this project in order to become better educated about the rising issue of fake news and its prevalance in today's society. Additionally, we found the current research being done to investigate fake news highly interesting and a great opportunity to learn and apply core principles in machine learning and natural language processing.
